                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi! My name is Sumaiya, and I am 20 years old. I'm currently studying at AlmaU in Almaty. I'm passionate about technology, blogging, and sharing my experiences. I enjoy writing about topics ranging from daily life to university life and everything in between.</p>
                
                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>I'm pursuing my degree in Business Administration at AlmaU, where I have gained a lot of practical knowledge about business strategies, entrepreneurship, and digital marketing. My goal is to combine my love for tech with my business education to create something innovative.</p>

                <h3>Interests</h3>
                <p>In my free time, I love exploring new technologies, reading, and cooking. I enjoy sharing my thoughts and experiences with others, which is why I started this blog! It gives me the opportunity to connect with people who share similar interests and values.</p>

                <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
                <p>I once cooked a 3-course meal for my friends, and it turned out to be a hit! I might even share the recipe here sometime!</p>
